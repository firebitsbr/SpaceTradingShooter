Ship fighting agains AI and Warp mechanic to other planets.

The warp mechanic tries to use a visual illusion by moving planets with the player when the player is in sublight speed and keeping the player static when using Warp speed and only moving and scaling the planets.  
This gives the illusion that when in sublight speed the distance is so far that planets are static and when enabling Warp the planets start moving.
